# the 'template:' key provdes a go text-template that
# receives the CbR message as a map, with string keys and values
# corresponding to the cbr message like map[string] interface{}
# which can be manipulated fairly easily in the templating language provided by go
# use .Key to acces the value of Key

#output plugins
# The 4.0 event forwarder features modular and customizable outputs
# called plugins
# these output plugins can be written by users in golang
# allowing the definition of new output-types necessitating upstream contributions
# the output plugins can do more or less anything a 'real output' type can do
# and can be used along side the usual output types from 3.x and prior

# plugins/output/kafka
# provides a new implentation of the kafka output as a plugin
# this .so is loaded at runtime by the forwarder
# to allow for output w/ kafka brokers
# the plugin uses go-confluent-kafka which relies on the librdkafka.so
# modular plugins allow the forwarder to support this great kafka library
# w/o tying down non-kafka use cases to requiring librdkafka1.so
#
#
# general structure of plugin conf
#output:
#    - plugin:
#        path: path/to/the.so
#        plugin: nameoftheso
#        config:
#            ...config goes here if needed...
#
# the kafka plugin takes 3 arguments:
# producer:
#    bootstrap.servers: localhost:9092
# this feeds parameters to the underlying kafka-producer,exactly like x.y=v
# this is entirely optional, with reasonable defaults in place
# but users can feel free to customize the producer config to their linking
# the topic suffix parameter allows added a suffix to the produced topics
# which are otherwised set to the 'type' of the outgoing message
# topicSuffix: -mydesiredsuffix
# and is in general a great example of how to write your own output plugin for the event-forwarder
