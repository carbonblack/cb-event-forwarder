# How many process pools should the script spin up to
# process events off of the bus.

#
# This is a name that gets populated in all JSON objects
# as "cb_server".  This can help distinguish messages when
# data from multiple Carbon Black deployments are merged
# into a single source

#
# Bus Connection Options
#
# There are two deployment options:
#
# 1) For small deployments, or for low volume subscriptions (such as new binaries, feed/watchlist hits),
#    you can install this connector directly on the Carbon Black server. In this case, leave the following
#    three configuration options blank and the service will connect to the local RabbitMQ instance using
#    the credentials from the /etc/cb/cb.conf file.
#
# 2) For larger deployments, or for high volume subscriptions (such as raw endpoint events), it is recommended
#    to install this connector on its own dedicated machine. In this case, fill the following three configuration
#    options with the RabbitMQUser, RabbitMQPassword, and the IP/hostname of the Carbon Black server or master
#    node respectively. You will have to ensure that your host can connect to TCP port 5004 on the Carbon Black
#    server.
#
rabbit_mq_username=
rabbit_mq_password=
cb_server_hostname=

#
# The cb-event-forwarder can optionally place deep links into the JSON or LEEF output so users can have
# one-click access to process, binary, or sensor context. For example, a watchlist process hit will now include:
#  .docs[0].link_sensor: https://cbtests/#/host/7
#  .docs[0].link_process: https://cbtests/#analyze/00000007-0000-0fd4-01d1-209aa22a57ee/1
#  .docs[0].link_parent: https://cbtests/#analyze/00000007-0000-0fc8-01d1-209aa208f788/1
#  .docs[0].link_process_md5: https://cbtests/#/binary/445C3E95C8CB05403AEDAEC3BAAA3A1D
#
# Raw endpoint events will include a "link_process", and binary watchlist hits will include a "link_md5"
#
# To enable these links, uncomment and place the base URL of your Carbon Black server into the cb_server_url variable
# below.
#
# cb_server_url=https://my.company.cb.server

# Output Options
#########

#
# Configure the specific output.
# Valid options are: 'udp', 'tcp', 'file', 'stdout', 's3'
#
#  udp - Have the events sent over a UDP socket
#  tcp - Have the events sent over a TCP socket
#  file - Output the events to a rotating file
#  s3 - Place in S3 bucket (not officially supported)
#
output_type=file

# Configure the output format
# valid options are: 'leef', 'json'
#
# default is 'json'
# Use 'leef' for pushing events to IBM QRadar, 'json' otherwise
#
output_format=json

#
# Output specific configuration
# These only have meaning if the option
# is enabled
#

# default to /var/cb/data/event_bridge_output.json
outfile=/var/cb/data/event_bridge_output.json

# tcpout=IP:port - ie 1.2.3.5:8080
tcpout=

# udpout=IP:port - ie 1.2.3.5:8080
udpout=

# options for S3 support
# s3out: can be an S3 bucket name (defaults to us-east-1 region)
#        or (temp-file-directory):(region):(bucket-name)
#        by default, the temp-file-directory is /var/cb/data/event-forwarder.
#
# for more s3 options, see the [s3] section below.
s3out=

#########
# Configuration for which events are captured
#
# To specify multiple events use comma as a separator
# e.g. events_raw_sensor=ingress.event.process,ingress.event.procstart
#
#
# For more info on supported event types see
# https://github.com/carbonblack/cbapi/tree/master/server_apis
#
# Note: To enable raw sensor events you must also edit the Carbon Black config
#  file (cb.conf) and enable the appropriate events by changing the config
#  option DatastoreBroadcastEventTypes.
#
# Note: To enable binaryinfo. events you need to enable EnableSolrBinaryInfoNotifications=True
#  within the cb.conf
