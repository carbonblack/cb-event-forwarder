# VMware Carbon Black EDR Event Forwarder

## Overview

The VMware Carbon Black EDR Event Forwarder is a standalone service which listens on the EDR enterprise bus and exports
events (watchlist/feed hits, as well as raw endpoint events, if configured) in a normalized JSON or LEEF format.
The events can be saved to a file, delivered to a network service or archived automatically to an Amazon AWS S3 bucket.
These events can be consumed by any external system that accepts JSON or LEEF, including Splunk and IBM QRadar.

The list of events to collect is configurable. By default, Event Forwarder exports all feed and watchlist hits, alerts,
binary notifications, and raw sensor events as JSON. You can find the configuration file for the connector at
`/etc/cb/integrations/event-forwarder/cb-event-forwarder.conf`.

Starting with version 7.1.0 of EDR, you can use the EDR web console to configure and control Event Forwarder,
as long as you follow the installation and configuration steps detailed below.

## Raw Sensor Events 

We have seen a performance impact when exporting all raw sensor events onto the enterprise bus by setting
"DatastoreBroadcastEventTypes=True" in the EDR configuration (more on this below). We do not recommend exporting all
the events, and recommend that you configure -- at most -- only process and netconn events for broadcasting on the event
bus. 

## Quickstart Guide

The cb-event-forwarder can be installed on any 64-bit Linux machine running CentOS 6.x. 
It can be installed on the same machine as the EDR server, or another machine. 
If you are forwarding a large volume of events to QRadar (for example, all file modifications and/or registry 
modifications), or are forwarding events from a EDR cluster, we recommend installing it on a separate machine. 
Otherwise, it is acceptable to install the cb-event-forwarder on the EDR server itself.

### Installation

#### Standard RPM-based installation

To install and configure the cb-event-forwarder, perform these steps as "root" on your target Linux system. NOTE: if you plan
to use the EDR console to configure and control cb-event-forwarder, then you MUST install it on the same system on which
EDR is installed (in the case of a cluster installer, this means the primary node).

1. Install the CbOpenSource repository if it isn't already present:

    ```
    cd /etc/yum.repos.d
    curl -O https://opensource.carbonblack.com/release/x86_64/CbOpenSource.repo
    ```
2. Install the RPM via YUM: 

   ```
   yum install cb-event-forwarder
   ```
3. If you are using EDR 7.1.0 or greater and wish to use the EDR console to configure and operate the Event
Forwarder, run the following script to set the appropriate permissions needed by EDR:

   ```
   /usr/share/cb/integrations/event-forwarder/cb-edr-fix-permissions.sh
   ```
#### Installation for EDR in docker

EDR has been available as a Dockerized install since version 7.7.0. 
Event Forwarder versions prior to 3.8.2 do not work with Carbon Black EDR containerized servers.
A new dockerized edition of Event Forwarder is now available as of EF 3.8.2 for use with Dockerized EDR. 
It can be installed with this procedure:

#### Procedure

1. Retrieve the containerized version of Event Forwarder 3.8.2 with docker using this command:  
`docker pull projects.registry.vmware.com/carbonblack/event-forwarder:3.8.2`
2. Retag the downloaded Event Forwarder image using this command:  
`docker tag projects.registry.vmware.com/carbonblack/event-forwarder:3.8.2 projects.registry.vmware.com/carbonblack/event-forwarder:latest`
3. From the directory where the edr-docker script is installed, extract the yml file using this command:    
`docker run --rm --entrypoint=/bin/cat projects.registry.vmware.com/carbonblack/event-forwarder:latest /compose.yml > event-forwarder.yml`
4. Set up Carbon Black EDR to control Event Forwarder. Edit data/config/cb.conf and add the following values:  
`EventForwarderEnabled=True`  
`EventForwarderContainerAddress=carbonblack-event-forwarder`    
`EventForwarderContainerPort=5744`
5. Run the Event Forwarder docker container using this command:  
`docker-compose -f event-forwarder.yml up -d`

#### Results

Configuration is saved in data/integrations/event-forwarder.  
* The Carbon Black EDR data folder is re-used
* If you encounter difficulties logging can be found in `data/logs/event-forwarder` directory and additional logging 
information for Event Forwarder is available by use thing this command: `docker logs -f carbonblackevent-forwarder`


### Configure the cb-event-forwarder

1. If installing on a machine *other than* the EDR server:
   1. Create a new RabbitMQ user by executing the following commands as root on the EDR server: 
   ```
   /usr/share/cb/cbrabbitmqctl add_user <username> <password>
   /usr/share/cb/cbrabbitmqctl set_user_tags <username> administrator
   /usr/share/cb/cbrabbitmqctl set_permissions -p / <username> ".*" ".*" ".*"
   ```
   2. Set the `rabbit_mq_username` and `rabbit_mq_password` variables in `/etc/cb/integrations/event-forwarder/cb-event-forwarder.conf` to the credentials you used in the preceding step 
file. Also fill out the `cb_server_hostname` with the hostname or IP address where the EDR server can be reached. 
2. If the cb-event-forwarder is forwarding events from a EDR cluster, the `cb_server_hostname` should be set
to the hostname or IP address of the EDR primary node.
   
3. Ensure that the configuration is valid by running the cb-event-forwarder in Check mode: 
`/usr/share/cb/integrations/event-forwarder/cb-event-forwarder -check` as root. If everything is OK, you will see a 
message starting with "Initialized output‚Äù. If there are any errors, those errors will be printed to your screen.

### Configure EDR

#### Console Support

If you are using EDR 7.1.0 or greater and wish to use the EDR console to configure and operate the Event
Forwarder, you will need to add the following setting to `/etc/cb/cb.conf` (on the primary node, if this is a cluster):

    EventForwarderEnabled=True
 
 after which you must restart services (or restart the cluster).

#### Event Publishing

By default, Cb publishes the `feed.*` and `watchlist.*` events over the bus (see the [Events documentation](EVENTS.md)
for more information). 
If you want to capture raw sensor events or the `binaryinfo.*` notifications, you have to enable those features in 
`/etc/cb/cb.conf`:

* If you are capturing raw sensor events, you must set the `EnableRawSensorDataBroadcast` option to `True`.
* If you are capturing binary observed events you also need to edit the `EnableSolrBinaryInfoNotifications` option in 
`/etc/cb/cb.conf` and set it to `True`.
* If you would like feed hit events to include report titles, you must set the `FeedHitLoadReportTitles` option to `True`.

EDR needs to be restarted if any you change any variables in `/etc/cb/cb.conf` by executing
`/usr/share/cb/cbservice cb-enterprise restart`.

If you are configuring the cb-event-forwarder on a EDR cluster, the `EnableRawSensorDataBroadcast` and/or
`EnableSolrBinaryInfoNotifications` settings
must be distributed to the `/etc/cb/cb.conf` configuration file on all minion nodes and the cluster stopped and started using
the `/usr/share/cb/cbcluster stop && /usr/share/cb/cbcluster start` command.

### Starting and Stopping the Service

#### CentOS 6.x
* To start the service: `service cb-event-forwarder start`
* To stop the service: `service cb-event-forwarder stop`

#### CentOS 7.x/8.x
* To start the service: `systemctl start cb-event-forwarder`
* To stop the service: `systemctl stop cb-event-forwarder`

Once you install the service, it is configured to start automatically on system boot.

## Splunk

The EDR Event Forwarder can be used to export EDR events in a way easily configured for Splunk. You'll
need to install and configure the Splunk TA to consume the EDR event data. We recommend using SPLUNK HEC, and configuring the event-forwarder to publish events as json to the Splunk HEC route (typically `/services/collector`). If the HEC input is configured to use dedicated channels, you must include a channel identifer as a URL-parameter in this route like `/services/collector?channel=FE0ECFAD-13D5-401B-847D-77733BD77137`

More information about configuring the Splunk TA can be found [here](http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/AddOns/latest/Bit9CarbonBlack/About)
More information about configuring the Splunk HEC input can be found [here](https://https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/8.1.2/Data/AboutHECIDXAck)

## QRadar

The EDR Event Forwarder can forward EDR events in the LEEF format to QRadar. To forward EDR
events to a QRadar server:

1. Modify `/etc/cb/integrations/event-forwarder/cb-event-forwarder.conf` to include 
`udpout=<qradaripaddress>:<port>` (NOTE: Port is usually 514)
2. Change the output format to LEEF in the configuration file: `output_format=leef`.
3. Change the output type to UDP in the configuration file: `output_type=udp`.

For more information on the LEEF format, see the [Events documentation](EVENTS.md).

## Logging & Diagnostics

The connector logs to the directory `/var/log/cb/integrations/cb-event-forwarder`. An example of a successful startup log:

In addition to the log file, the service starts an HTTP service for monitoring and debugging. The URL is available in 
the log file (see the ‚ÄúDiagnostics available‚Äù line above). The port is configurable through the `http_server_port`
option in the configuration file.

The diagnostics are presented as a JSON formatted string. The diagnostics include operational information on the
service itself, how long the service has been running, errors, and basic configuration information. An example
output from the JSON status is shown below:

## Building from source

It is recommended to use the latest golang available on your target system - at the time of writing this is 1.13.x.

Set up your GOPATH, GOBIN, PATH environmental variables and make sure you have cloned the project into a directory structure in keeping with go's [workspace guide](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#Workspaces).

Set `GO111MODULE=on` to activate optional module support. The project can be built using the provided makefile. 

```
make build 
```

To build an RPM package, use `make rpm`. Make sure to set the `RPM_OUTPUT_DIR` environment variable to the location of your desired RPMBUILD directory; For instance if you set `RPM_OUTPUT_DIR=/home/user` the result will be located at `/home/user/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64`.
