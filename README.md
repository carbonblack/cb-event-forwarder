# Cb Response Event Forwarder

## Overview

The Cb Response Event Forwarder is a standalone service that will listen on the Cb Response enterprise bus and export
events (both watchlist/feed hits as well as raw endpoint events, if configured) in a normalized JSON or LEEF format.
The events can be saved to a file, delivered to a network service or archived automatically to an Amazon AWS S3 bucket.
These events can be consumed by any external system that accepts JSON or LEEF, including Splunk and IBM QRadar.

The list of events to collect is configurable.
By default all feed and watchlist hits, alerts, binary notifications, and raw sensor events are exported into JSON.  The
configuration file for the connector is stored in `/etc/cb/integrations/event-forwarder/cb-event-forwarder.conf`.

## Support

The pre-built RPM is supported via our [User eXchange (Jive)](https://community.carbonblack.com/community/developer-relations) 
and via email to dev-support@carbonblack.com.  

## Raw Sensor Events 

We have seen a performance impact when exporting all raw sensor events onto the enterprise bus.  We do not recommend
exporting all the events.  The performance impacts are seen when the events are broadcast on the bus, by enabling the
"DatastoreBroadcastEventTypes".  We recommend that at most, only process and netconn events be broadcast on the event
bus. 

## Quickstart Guide

The cb-event-forwarder can be installed on any 64-bit Linux machine running CentOS 6.x. 
It can be installed on the same machine as the Cb Response server, or another machine. 
If you are forwarding a large volume of events to QRadar (for example, all file modifications and/or registry 
modifications), or are forwarding events from a Cb Response cluster, then installing it on a separate machine is recommended. 
Otherwise, it is acceptable to install the cb-event-forwarder on the Cb Response server itself.

### Installation

To install and configure the cb-event-forwarder, perform these steps as "root" on your target Linux system. NOTE: if you plan
to use the CD EDR console to configure and control cb-event-forwarder, then you MUST install it on the same system on which
CB EDR is installed (in the case of a cluster installer, this means the master node).

1. Install the CbOpenSource repository if it isn't already present:

    ```
    cd /etc/yum.repos.d
    curl -O https://opensource.carbonblack.com/release/x86_64/CbOpenSource.repo
    ```
2. Install the RPM via YUM: 

   ```
   yum install cb-event-forwarder
   ```
3. If you will be using the CB EDR console to configure and operate the event forwarder, run the following script to set
the appropriate permissions needed by EDR:

   ```
   /usr/share/cb/integrations/event-forwarder/cb-edr-fix-permissions.sh
   ```

### Configure the cb-event-forwarder

1. If installing on a machine *other than* the Cb Response server, copy the RabbitMQ username and password into the 
`rabbit_mq_username` and `rabbit_mq_password` variables in `/etc/cb/integrations/event-forwarder/cb-event-forwarder.conf` 
file. Also fill out the `cb_server_hostname` with the hostname or IP address where the Cb Response server can be reached.
If the cb-event-forwarder is forwarding events from a Cb Response cluster, the `cb_server_hostname` should be set
to the hostname or IP address of the Cb Response master node.
   
2. Ensure that the configuration is valid by running the cb-event-forwarder in Check mode: 
`/usr/share/cb/integrations/event-forwarder/cb-event-forwarder -check` as root. If everything is OK, you will see a 
message starting with "Initialized output”. If there are any errors, those errors will be printed to your screen.

### Configure Cb Response

By default, Cb publishes the `feed.*` and `watchlist.*` events over the bus (see the [Events documentation](EVENTS.md)
for more information). 
If you want to capture raw sensor events or the `binaryinfo.*` notifications, you have to enable those features in 
`/etc/cb/cb.conf`:

* If you are capturing raw sensor events then you also need to edit the `DatastoreBroadcastEventTypes` option in 
`/etc/cb/cb.conf` to enable broadcast of the raw sensor events you wish to export.
* If you are capturing binary observed events you also need to edit the `EnableSolrBinaryInfoNotifications` option in 
`/etc/cb/cb.conf` and set it to `True`.

Cb Response needs to be restarted if any variables were changed in `/etc/cb/cb.conf` by executing
`service cb-enterprise restart`. 

If you are configuring the cb-event-forwarder on a Cb Response cluster, the `DatastoreBroadcastEventTypes` and/or
`EnableSolrBinaryInfoNotifications` settings
must be distributed to the `/etc/cb/cb.conf` configuration file on all minion nodes and the cluster stopped and started using
the `/usr/share/cb/cbcluster stop && /usr/share/cb/cbcluster start` command.

### Starting and Stopping the Service

#### CentOS 6.x
Once the service is installed, it is managed by the Upstart init system in CentOS 6.x. You can control the service via the 
initctl command.
* To start the service, `initctl start cb-event-forwarder`
* To stop the service, `initctl stop cb-event-forwarder`

#### CentOS 7.x
* To start the service, `systemctl start cb-event-forwarder`
* To stop the service, `systemctl stop cb-event-forwarder`

Once the service is installed, it is configured to start automatically on system boot.

## Splunk

The Cb Response event forwarder can be used to export Cb Response events in a way easily configured for Splunk.  You'll
need to install and configure the Splunk TA to consume the Cb Response event data.   It is recommended that the event
bridge use a file based output with Splunk universal forwarder configured to monitor the file.   

More information about configuring the Splunk TA can be found [here](http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/AddOns/latest/Bit9CarbonBlack/About)

## QRadar

The Cb Response event forwarder can forward Cb Response events in the LEEF format to QRadar. To forward Cb Response
events to a QRadar server:

1. Modify `/etc/cb/integrations/event-forwarder/cb-event-forwarder.conf` to include 
`udpout=<qradaripaddress>:<port>` (NOTE: Port is usually 514)
2. Change the output format to LEEF in the configuration file: `output_format=leef`.
3. Change the output type to UDP in the configuration file: `output_type=udp`.

For more information on the LEEF format, see the [Events documentation](EVENTS.md).

## Logging & Diagnostics

The connector logs to the directory `/var/log/cb/integrations/cb-event-forwarder`. An example of a successful startup log:

In addition to the log file, the service starts an HTTP service for monitoring and debugging. The URL is available in 
the log file (see the “Diagnostics available” line above). The port is configurable through the `http_server_port`
option in the configuration file.

The diagnostics are presented as a JSON formatted string. The diagnostics include operational information on the
service itself, how long the service has been running, errors, and basic configuration information. An example
output from the JSON status is shown below:

## Building from source

It is recommended to use the latest golang available on your target system - at the time of writing this is 1.13.x.

Set up your GOPATH, GOBIN, PATH environmental variables and make sure you have cloned the project into a directory structure in keeping with go's [workspace guide](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#Workspaces).

Set `GO111MODULE=on` to activate optional module support. The project can be built using the provided makefile. 

The project requires librdkafka.so to be available and on the PKG_CONFIG_PATH for your build-system. Follow the guide in [go-confluent-kafka](https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-go) to make sure librdkafka is installed correctly, either from source or one of the confluent provided repositories.
```
make build 
```

To build an RPM package, use `make rpm`. By default, the result will be located at `~/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64`.
