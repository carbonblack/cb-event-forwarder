#
# Bus Connection Options
#
# There are two deployment options:
#
# 1) For small deployments, or for low volume subscriptions (such as new binaries, feed/watchlist hits),
#    you can install this connector directly on the Cb Response server. In this case, leave the following
#    three configuration options blank and the service will connect to the local RabbitMQ instance using
#    the credentials from the /etc/cb/cb.conf file.
#
# 2) For larger deployments, or for high volume subscriptions (such as raw endpoint events), it is recommended
#    to install this connector on its own dedicated machine. In this case, fill the following three configuration
#    options with the RabbitMQUser, RabbitMQPassword, and the IP/hostname of the Cb Response server or master
#    node respectively. You will have to ensure that your host can connect to TCP port 5004 on the Cb Response
#    server.
#
rabbit_mq_username=cb
rabbit_mq_password=cb
cb_server_hostname=rabbitmq
rabbit_mq_port=5672

# Rabbit MQ Acking
# RabbitMQ has two options for acking events off of the message bus, automatic and manual.
# In automatic acknowledgement mode, a message is considered to be successfully delivered
# immediately after it is sent. This mode trades off higher throughput (as long as the consumers can keep up)
# for reduced safety of delivery and consumer processing. With manual acking, the
# consumer must ack each individual event sent by the producer and an event will not
# be considered sucessfully received until the consumer sends an ack to the producer.
# See https://www.rabbitmq.com/confirms.html for a more detailed explination.
# Automatic acking is recommended as not all environments can keep up with the rate of acking
# that is required. If manual acking is desired, please be sure to make sure that your
# consumers can keep up with the number of acks necessary. This can be done by increasing
# message_processor_count, using EnableRawSensorDataBroadcast vs events_raw_sensor,
# and using rabbit_mq_queue_name while running multiple instances of the Event Forwarder.
# If rabbit_mq_automatic_acking is set to true then automatic mode is used, if
# rabbit_mq_automatic_acking is false then manual mode will be used. The default is true.
#
rabbit_mq_automatic_acking=true


# Rabbit MQ queue Name
# The RabbitMQ queue name is the name of the queue that is created on the RabbitMQ server
# from which the event forwarder will receive events. By default this name is made up of a static
# string, the hostname of the machine it's running on, and the pid of the event forwarder process.
# This might not be desired in high throughput environments where it's necessary to run multiple instances
# of the event forwarder in order to keep up with the volume of events coming off of the RabbitMQ event bus.
# By setting rabbit_mq_queue_name to a static string the queue name will be the same across all running
# instances of the event forwarder, allowing multiple instances of the event forwarder to consume from the
# same RabbitMQ queue. The default is an empty string.
#
rabbit_mq_queue_name=

#
# The cb-event-forwarder can optionally place deep links into the JSON or LEEF output so users can have
# one-click access to process, binary, or sensor context. For example, a watchlist process hit will now include:
#  .docs[0].link_sensor: https://cbtests/#/host/7
#  .docs[0].link_process: https://cbtests/#analyze/00000007-0000-0fd4-01d1-209aa22a57ee/1

#  .docs[0].link_process_md5: https://cbtests/#/binary/445C3E95C8CB05403AEDAEC3BAAA3A1D
#
# Raw endpoint events will include a "link_process", and binary watchlist hits will include a "link_md5"
#
# To enable these links, uncomment and place the base URL of your Cb Response server into the cb_server_url variable
# below.

# The cb_server_url is also used for any post processing that requires the Cb Response Server's REST API access.
#
# cb_server_url=https://my.company.cb.server

#
# Post Processing Options
#
# Supported post processing:
#
# 1) report_title in feed hits
#
# Post processing requires cb_server_url, api_verify_ssl, and api_token to be set.  The post processed messages are
# dispatched to retrieve additional information from the Cb Response REST API.  Once the information is retrieved they
# are placed in the ouput queue.

# Configuration for which events are captured
#
# To specify multiple events use comma as a separator
# e.g. events_raw_sensor=ingress.event.process,ingress.event.procstart
#
#
# For more info on supported event types see
# https://github.com/carbonblack/cbapi/tree/master/server_apis
#
# Note: To enable raw sensor events you must also edit the Cb Response config
#  file (cb.conf) and enable the appropriate events by changing the config
#  option DatastoreBroadcastEventTypes.
#
# If you intend to enable raw sensor events on a Cb Enterprise Response 5.2+ server,
#  consider using the "raw sensor exchange" for enhanced performance and reduced
#  load on the Cb server. The raw exchange forwards the compressed data received
#  from the endpoint sensor unchanged to the event-forwarder. The raw sensor
#  exchange should be used if you are forwarding moduleload, filemod, or regmod
#  endpoint events as these represent the vast majority of the event types.
#
# To use the "raw sensor exchange", first uncomment the "use_raw_sensor_exchange"
#  option below:
use_raw_sensor_exchange=true
#
#  then enable the "raw sensor exchange" in cb.conf:
#  EnableRawSensorDataBroadcast=true
#
# Note: To enable binaryinfo. events you need to enable EnableSolrBinaryInfoNotifications=True
#  within the cb.conf

# Use the following credential profile to connect to S3.
# See http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html for more information on

# credential storage location of $HOME/.aws/credentials with the "default" credential profile.
#
# The credential_profile can be specified as the profile name, using the default storage location, or
# you can also specify the filename where the credentials are stored by using a colon separated format:

# set credential_profile to /etc/cb/aws.creds:production.
